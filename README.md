## Compiler

The compiler is used to compile instructions written in `.asm` format to machine code. The usage of the compiler is described below.

Open up the terminal and go the `compiler` folder.

```
cd compiler
```

Compile instruction file to machine code with python.

```
python compiler.py test.asm
```

Machine code will be written to a text file with the same name as the input source file.

### Assembly Syntax

The syntax for the assembly files is quite simple. The available instructions are described in the instruction set table. Registers are named from R0 to R7. Literal values are in hexadecimal. Comments can be added with the `;` symbol. See `test.asm` for an example.
